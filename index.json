Data visualisation plays an important role in communicating research to others. This is especially the case in policy-making processes, where researchers want to avoid misinterpretation of empirical evidence.\nKnow our stuff Participants agreed that for being able to communicate research through visualisations, researchers first have to understand what they are doing. This may seem like a no-brainer but researchers have to make themselves familiar with the data they are working with, and, depending on the discipline, with the mechanisms that contribute to the observed patterns in the data.\nResearchers are responsible for their products, and responsibility can best be borne by knowledgeable people.\nFinding the middle ground The challenge that most participants of the round table addressed was to deal with trade-offs between simplicity and complexity. Policy makers want numbers to quantify things but a single number often provides incomplete information of complex relationships in the data. Dataviz helps to attach more information to numbers but visualising data properly takes more time—and time is a limited resource in policy-making processes.\n","date":1688601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688601600,"objectID":"f3a45ccf448e9855f5f72be29f7ee494","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2020-07-06-dataviz-round-table/","publishdate":"2023-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-07-06-dataviz-round-table/","section":"post","summary":"Together with Nikola Sander, I chaired a session on dataviz in policy relevant research at BiB's anniversary conference *Turning Gold*.","tags":["Dataviz"],"title":"Round table on dataviz in policy relevant research","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":["Conference","Talk"],"content":"What happens when expectations of immigrants about live abroad do not meet with their experiences?

I study patterns and trends in various forms of spatial mobility in order to reveal interdependencies between them, and to better understand population dynamics. For this purpose, parts of my work are explicitly dedicated to the visualisation of human migration flows by using circular migration plots. Circular migration plots are a viable alternative to conventional flow maps and other existing visualisations of migration flows. They are an effective and visually appealing method for visualising flow data because they allow the reader to quickly identify key patterns and trends.\nYou will find guidance and code that help you create your own circular migration plots in the context of “The Global Flow of People 2.0” project and the handbook article listed below.

Most individuals emigrate in their adulthood, which means their cultural traits are less malleable once they start living abroad. Cultural differences to non-immigrants therefore become relatively constant distances immigrants have to deal with. Thus, it is important to better understand what role cultural distances play in adapting to a new environment, with increasing time spent abroad, and how immigrants can cope with related challenges. In this project, you will find personal work on these topics.\nRelated work Work in progress | Cultural distance and immigrant adjustment | with Jean Philippe Décieux and Elke Murdock | more info Work in progress | Expatriate adjustment and the role of cultural distance | with Jean Philippe Décieux and Heiko Rüger ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"cbcda59cdf6e8305420f8781643ede7a","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/project/cultural-contact-in-migration-contexts/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cultural-contact-in-migration-contexts/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of work that looks at the role of cultural distance for immigrants' lives abroad","tags":["Culture","Cultural difference","Cultural distance","Adaptation","Adjustment"],"title":"Cultural distance and adaptation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Andreas Genoni","Jean Philippe Décieux","Elke Murdock"],"categories":null,"content":"The cultural distance (CD) between the country of origin and destination country of migrants has long been considered important for adjustment in international migration. Past research has mainly followed a cost perspective, pointing to rising costs in adjustment with increasing CD, postulating a negative linear relationship. Following this logic, previous studies overlooked potential benefits of CD for adjustment. We address this gap by taking a more differentiated perspective on CD and adjustment. Using unique probability-based survey data on German migrants in 38 destination countries with a maximum length of stay of 36 months, we examined different CD-levels and their consequences for adjustment. We ran multilevel regressions for sociocultural and psychological adjustment. Importantly, our findings indicate that the CD effect on adjustment is not linear but clearly resembles an inverted-U shape for both adjustment dimensions. This result challenges the cost perspective and suggests an “optimal” range of intermediate CD as most beneficial for recent migrants’ adjustment. We conclude that the prevailing view on the consequences of CD for migrant adjustment holds true for very large CDs, but it underestimates the challenges for culturally close migrants and overlooks that a certain level of cultural dissimilarity can facilitate migrants’ adjustment.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"6a49663f6a85f4a438bf001a963d6190","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/cd-and-adjustment/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current-work/cd-and-adjustment/","section":"current-work","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

This question is a tough one, because it is one of cause and effect and requires unique data to address it.\nFor example, it is not sufficient to compare individuals after their move abroad with non-migrated individuals in their home country, because differences between these groups may be the result of specific characteristics of the individuals within the two groups. If we imagine that migration can be a stressful live event, individuals who move abroad might be healthier and more resilient than individuals who stay put, because migration would otherwise not be feasible.\nThus, if researchers would find physical and mental health advantages among migrants, it would be unclear whether they made this discovery because migrants are genuinely healthier and happier, or because migration itself may have contributed to their increased health and happiness. By the way, the thought of migration as a potentially positive life event is not far-fetched at all, because migration may not only be stressful but also open up individual opportunities to develop and thrive.\nApparently, addressing the question of cause and effect of migration places an extremely high demand on data. They have to be longitudinal and must include actual migration events. This enables researchers to observe individuals before, during and after their move abroad, and to compare these different stages with each other.\nBut how can researchers find and survey individuals who will move abroad during the time of a planned panel survey? Unless researchers are blessed with foresight, they have to come up with a promising strategy. Luckily, my colleagues at the BiB did so. The German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS) meets these high data demands. Following Germans who shortly moved abroad or returned to Germany before the survey started, we collected data of a internationally highly mobile population with a high probability of being internationally mobile again.\nThe work listed below is based on these unique data. It aims to tighten the boundaries of causal inference by shedding light on the actual consequences of international migration for immigrants’ lives.\nRelated work Work in progress | International migration and the subjective well-being of internationally mobile individuals | with Nico Stawarz, Andreas Ette, and Heiko Rüger | more info ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"84b83b451e7be93626441e8403bcb7ff","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/project/consequences-of-international-migration/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/consequences-of-international-migration/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of work about migration and its impact on the live of internationally mobile individuals","tags":["Integration","Discrimination","Identity"],"title":"Individual consequences of international migration","type":"project"},{"authors":["Andreas Genoni","Nico Stawarz","Andreas Ette","Heiko Rüger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"ca3a534a3749c6f55ff21304e80847ea","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/mig-and-swb/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current-work/mig-and-swb/","section":"current-work","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In the past years, however, increasingly more attention has been given to the “inner life” of immigrants, referring to more “subjective” indicators of integration such as their emotional attachment to the new home, their feelings of belongingness to its society or their perceptions of discrimination.\nWith the continued publication of empirical studies on immigrants’ subjective integration, an integration paradox has been revealed: Many of those immigrants who seem integrated in terms of their education or occupational status do not feel that they are.\nSuch a misalignment can be problematic because it may increase the likelihood of frustration, mental health issues, and emigration. But the seemingly better integrated are particularly valuable for receiving societies because they can play an important role in helping new arrivals to participate and incorporate into the institutions of the mainstream society. Furthermore, they are more efficiently deployable in the local labour market and less at risk from unemployment. These issues are particularly pressing in times when many developed countries face labour shortages and compete for talents globally.\nThis project bundles personal work on the integration paradox. It looks at different factors and mechanisms that contribute to this paradox, and tries to better understand the potential issues and consequences related to it.\nRelated work 2022 | Status and Ethnic Identity.
