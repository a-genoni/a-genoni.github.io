We use data from the TransFAR project, a BiB survey about Eritrean and Syrian recent refugees in Germany.

This so-called integration paradox is thought to occur because of two basic, mutually independent mechanisms: (1) highly educated immigrants more often experience unmet migration expectations, and (2) show stronger negative reactions when their expectations about their life abroad are not met. Existing research mainly focused on the first mechanism, and empirically tracing the second has been challenging due to a lack of evidence comparing less- and more-educated immigrants’ reactions over time. Here, we address this gap and examine how unmet migration expectations contribute to education-related differences in destination attachment. Using panel data on recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey (N = 5,242 immigrants and 13,890 observations, 2016-2022), we assessed the extent of unmet expectations and associated disappointment through a question on dissatisfaction with the decision to migrate. Consistent with theory, we found that increasingly negative evaluations of pre-migration expectations were linked to reduced destination attachment, especially for immigrants with higher levels of education. These results suggest a fundamental mechanism for the emergence of the integration paradox, enhancing our understanding of immigrant integration.\nSuggested citation: Genoni, A. \u0026amp; Ruedin, D.

Internationally mobile people often leave relevant others and material belongings behind and often find themselves in an unfamiliar environment, within which they sometimes even face reservations from the local population. As if all of this is not enough, moving abroad needs careful planning ahead, ensuring that crossing national borders and changing one’s place of residence is in accordance with all involved countries’ laws. Sounds quite stressful!\nWith so much stuff going on in the process of emigration, it’s hard to keep track of how well international migrants are doing overall. Clearly, just looking at how their income changes with the move doesn’t do justice to everything that is going on. We thus took a different approach an looked at shifts in the subjective well-being of individuals that are in the process of leaving their country to life somewhere else.\nThis study is unique as it is one of the first that is following people throughout their whole emigration process. This is made possible with the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS), a longitudinal study that is representative of the internationally mobile German population.\nThe results in a nutshell We are able to show a general increase in people’s well-being during their emigration. Importantly, this increase is not short-term as well-being remains elevated in the first years after migration. The extent of the change in well-being thereby systematically depends on negotiation processes related to the migration decision: accompanying individuals (so-called trailing partners) experience the smallest gains in well-being compared to those who made the migration decision jointly with their partner or those who were the driving force behind the migration (so-called leading partners). Being unconstrained by a partner, singles even showed more pronounced increases in their well-being.\nWhat can we learn from the study? The study suggests that, despite its associated challenges, international migration is generally positive for people from affluent societies. The increasing internationalization of education and careers, along with subsequent high return rates, supports policies that promote international mobility as recurring events in people’s lives. However, the findings also highlight potential social inequalities between those who migrate internationally and those who don’t.\nGet the article If you are interested in reading the whole article, you can head over to Migration Studies.

Past research predominantly followed a cost perspective, emphasising rising adjustment costs with increasing CD and postulating a negative linear relationship. Previous studies therefore overlooked potential benefits of CD for adjustment. We address this gap by taking a more differentiated perspective on CD and adjustment. Using probability-based survey data on recent German migrants , we examined migrant adjustment at different CD-levels. Employing multilevel regressions for sociocultural and psychological adjustment, the findings reveal an inverted-U shaped relationship between CD and both adjustment dimensions. This challenges the cost perspective, indicating an “optimal” range of intermediate CD as most beneficial for adjustment. Thus, the prevailing view on negative consequences of CD for adjustment may underestimate the challenges for culturally close migrants, and overlook that certain levels of cultural dissimilarity can facilitate migrants’ adjustment.\nSuggested citation: Genoni, A.; Décieux, J.

Among existing transfer publications on well-being, the monitor stands out with its focus on the most dissatisfied and satisfied people in the population. Going beyond the average well-being level of groups makes the report particularly useful for policy makers to maintain the well-being of the highly satisfied and improve the well-being of the most vulnerable groups.\nThe monitor is written in German but I give you a quick summary about what we’ve found for the migrant population.\nChildren of immigrants are the least satisfied Compared to immigrants and the resident population, children of immigrants are the least satisfied. They more often report particularly low satisfaction with their life.\nTake a look at the figure above: The children of immigrants–or the people from the so-called second generation–are shown in the middle. They have the highest share of people who are less satisfied (39.7%, represented by the blueish bar), and the lowest share of people who are very satisfied (12.1%, represented by the greenish bar).\nThese shares particularly contrast those in the immigrant population–the so-called first generation–, which you see on the far right in the figure.\nSmaller differences, bigger impact Strange, isn’t it? The second generation, whose living conditions are more similar to those of the resident population, are less satisfied than the first generation who immigrated themselves and have to find their way.\nOne of the most plausible explanations for this difference is that first- and second-generation migrants tend to use different reference points against which they evaluate their life and satisfaction with it. While immigrants more likely compare their current life abroad to their past in the origin country or non-migrated peers, children of immigrants tend to compare their situation more likely to that of the resident population. For immigrants, the comparison often feels positive, knowing that they left for a (hopefully) better future. For their children however, the comparison is often to their disadvantage, revealing the admittedly smaller but still existing inequalities that clash with unmet desires of same life chances and equal treatment.\nMore information You can download the Monitor here.

Thus, when thinking of less and more successful integration, we tend to have specific groups of migrants in mind. However, a considerable number of studies has illustrated that exclusively focusing on more objective indicators of integration is problematic as they do not necessarily match with how migrants perceive their own integration. Opposing classic assimilation theories, various studies have found support for this so-called Integration Paradox where migrants, typically with a higher socio-economic position, feel more socially excluded and less belonging to the residence country. The panel aims to dive into this counterintuitive finding in various ways, for example by examining specific sub-groups, disentangling underlying mechanisms, and exploring new outcomes of interest. We aim to better understand the reasons for why seemingly integrated migrants do not feel like they are, and engage in discussions about individual and societal consequences that arise from this paradox.\n","date":1694217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694217600,"objectID":"c6e8c88532d80aafe90bf4905f9ac757","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2023-09-09-imiscoe-cfp/","publishdate":"2023-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-09-09-imiscoe-cfp/","section":"post","summary":"I'm submitting a panel with Nella Geurts at next year's IMISCOE conference in Lisbon.

Most individuals emigrate in their adulthood, which means their cultural traits are less malleable once they start living abroad. Cultural differences to non-immigrants therefore become relatively constant distances immigrants have to deal with. Thus, it is important to better understand what role cultural distances play in adapting to a new environment, with increasing time spent abroad, and how immigrants can cope with related challenges. In this project, you will find personal work on these topics.\nRelated work 2023 | Is it all about the costs?

However, previous literature illustrates that conceptions of belonging can be derived from various levels, including supranational or more cosmopolitan ones such as Europe or the world as a whole. Combining these insights with studies on reactive ethnicity, we investigate to what extent identifying as cosmopolitan may be a reaction to stronger perceptions of social exclusion, and whether this differs for higher and lower educated immigrants. Our contribution to the IP literature is threefold: First, we explore how the integration paradox applies to supranational belonging by investigating belonging to Europe. Second, we use recent probability-based panel data by studying German migrants in over 130 countries worldwide. Third, by measuring feelings of being left out, we measure perceived social exclusion more broadly than by discrimination alone, arguing that also more implicit and indirect forms of exclusion affect immigrants’ feelings of belonging. Preliminary fixed effects analyses show that intensified feelings of being left out increase European attachment among immigrants in non-European countries, which is solely driven by higher educated immigrants, as lower educated immigrants show no such reactive behaviour. Overall, the study offers a new perspective on the drivers of cosmopolitanism by integrating insights from studies on the IP and reactive ethnicity, thereby also raising questions about the importance of national group membership for so-called world citizens.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"b823ed8783301c715b6d5175f14e94d6","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/reactive-cosmopolitanism/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current-work/reactive-cosmopolitanism/","section":"current-work","summary":"Reactive cosmopolitanism","tags":["International migration","Integration paradox","Discrimination","Supranational belonging","Fixed Effects","GERPS"],"title":"Reactive cosmopolitanism?

Governments therefore increasingly depend on highly skilled immigrants in particular to respond to these challenges. However, highly skilled immigrants are probably more at risk of leaving their current country of residence compared to their lower-skilled counterparts. Empirical evidence suggests that highly skilled immigrants react comparably stronger to unmet migration expectations as their expectations to do well, fare well and be treated equally are particularly high, thus being more prone to be disappointed. Being highly qualified and more likely to cope with monetary and psychological consequences of migration decisions, such disappointment might lead them to pursue alternative career perspectives elsewhere in the global labour market, eventually making them leave the country. Here we analyse how unmet migration expectations of immigrants affect the probability of leaving their current destination country, and whether there are educational differences. We use panel data of recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility (MMS) Survey and link them with administrative data to obtain information on immigrants’ whereabouts after being surveyed. Overall, we find that disappointed migration expectations increase the probability of immigrants to leave the country after the survey. Highly skilled immigrants are generally more likely to leave Switzerland than lower skilled immigrants. Importantly, however, we find that the stronger the migration disappointment, the greater is the likelihood of out-migration for highly skilled immigrants, making them particularly likely to leave.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"0fdecbcb84290fb367391554a95d2564","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/outmigration/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current-work/outmigration/","section":"current-work","summary":"Unmet migration expectations and out-migration","tags":["Expectations","Out-migration","skilled migration","Belonging","Integration Paradox","MMS","Panel data"],"title":"Should I stay or should I go?

In the past years, however, increasingly more attention has been given to the “inner life” of immigrants, referring to more “subjective” indicators of integration such as their emotional attachment to the new home, their feelings of belongingness to its society or their perceptions of discrimination.\nWith the continued publication of empirical studies on immigrants’ subjective integration, an integration paradox has been revealed: Many of those immigrants who seem integrated in terms of their education or occupational status do not feel that they are.\nSuch a misalignment can be problematic because it may increase the likelihood of frustration, mental health issues, and emigration. But the seemingly better integrated are particularly valuable for receiving societies because they can play an important role in helping new arrivals to participate and incorporate into the institutions of the mainstream society. Furthermore, they are more efficiently deployable in the local labour market and less at risk from unemployment. These issues are particularly pressing in times when many developed countries face labour shortages and compete for talents globally.\nThis project bundles personal work on the integration paradox. It looks at different factors and mechanisms that contribute to this paradox, and tries to better understand the potential issues and consequences related to it.\nRelated work 2022 | Status and Ethnic Identity.
