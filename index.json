Among existing transfer publications on well-being, the monitor stands out with its focus on the most dissatisfied and satisfied people in the population. Going beyond the average well-being level of groups makes the report particularly useful for policy makers to maintain the well-being of the highly satisfied and improve the well-being of the most vulnerable groups.\nThe monitor is written in German but I give you a quick summary about what we’ve found for the migrant population.\nChildren of immigrants are the least satisfied Compared to immigrants and the resident population, children of immigrants are the least satisfied. They more often report particularly low satisfaction with their life.\nTake a look at the figure above: The children of immigrants–or the people from the so-called second generation–are shown in the middle. They have the highest share of people who are less satisfied (39.7%, represented by the blueish bar), and the lowest share of people who are very satisfied (12.1%, represented by the greenish bar).\nThese shares particularly contrast those in the immigrant population–the so-called first generation–, which you see on the far right in the figure.\nSmaller differences, bigger impact Strange, isn’t it? The second generation, whose living conditions are more similar to those of the resident population, are less satisfied than the first generation who immigrated themselves and have to find their way.\nOne of the most plausible explanations for this difference is that first- and second-generation migrants tend to use different reference points against which they evaluate their life and satisfaction with it. While immigrants more likely compare their current life abroad to their past in the origin country or non-migrated peers, children of immigrants tend to compare their situation more likely to that of the resident population. For immigrants, the comparison often feels positive, knowing that they left for a (hopefully) better future. For their children however, the comparison is often to their disadvantage, revealing the admittedly smaller but still existing inequalities that clash with unmet desires of same life chances and equal treatment.\nMore information You can download the Monitor here.

Thus, when thinking of less and more successful integration, we tend to have specific groups of migrants in mind. However, a considerable number of studies has illustrated that exclusively focusing on more objective indicators of integration is problematic as they do not necessarily match with how migrants perceive their own integration. Opposing classic assimilation theories, various studies have found support for this so-called Integration Paradox where migrants, typically with a higher socio-economic position, feel more socially excluded and less belonging to the residence country. The panel aims to dive into this counterintuitive finding in various ways, for example by examining specific sub-groups, disentangling underlying mechanisms, and exploring new outcomes of interest. We aim to better understand the reasons for why seemingly integrated migrants do not feel like they are, and engage in discussions about individual and societal consequences that arise from this paradox.\n","date":1694217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694217600,"objectID":"c6e8c88532d80aafe90bf4905f9ac757","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2023-09-09-imiscoe-cfp/","publishdate":"2023-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-09-09-imiscoe-cfp/","section":"post","summary":"I'm submitting a panel with Nella Geurts at next year's IMISCOE conference in Lisbon.

Data visualisation plays an important role in communicating research to others. This is especially the case in policy-making processes, where researchers want to avoid misinterpretation of empirical evidence.\nKnowing our stuff Participants agreed that for being able to communicate research through visualisations, researchers first have to understand what they are doing. This may seem like a no-brainer but researchers have to make themselves familiar with the data they are working with, and, depending on the discipline, with the mechanisms that contribute to the observed patterns in the data.\nResearchers are responsible for their products, and responsibility can best be borne by knowledgeable people.\nFinding the middle ground The challenge that most participants of the round table addressed was to deal with trade-offs between simplicity and complexity.

Most individuals emigrate in their adulthood, which means their cultural traits are less malleable once they start living abroad. Cultural differences to non-immigrants therefore become relatively constant distances immigrants have to deal with. Thus, it is important to better understand what role cultural distances play in adapting to a new environment, with increasing time spent abroad, and how immigrants can cope with related challenges.

Past research has mainly followed a cost perspective, pointing to rising costs in adjustment with increasing CD, postulating a negative linear relationship. Following this logic, previous studies overlooked potential benefits of CD for adjustment. We address this gap by taking a more differentiated perspective on CD and adjustment. Using unique probability-based survey data on German migrants in 38 destination countries with a maximum length of stay of 36 months, we examined different CD-levels and their consequences for adjustment. We ran multilevel regressions for sociocultural and psychological adjustment. Importantly, our findings indicate that the CD effect on adjustment is not linear but clearly resembles an inverted-U shape for both adjustment dimensions. This result challenges the cost perspective and suggests an “optimal” range of intermediate CD as most beneficial for recent migrants’ adjustment. We conclude that the prevailing view on the consequences of CD for migrant adjustment holds true for very large CDs, but it underestimates the challenges for culturally close migrants and overlooks that a certain level of cultural dissimilarity can facilitate migrants’ adjustment.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"6a49663f6a85f4a438bf001a963d6190","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/cd-and-adjustment/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current-work/cd-and-adjustment/","section":"current-work","summary":"Cultural distance and immigrant adjustment","tags":["Cultural distance","Adjustment","Identity","GERPS"],"title":"Cultural distance and immigrant adjustment","type":"current-work"},{"authors":["Andreas Genoni","Nico Stawarz","Andreas Ette","Heiko Rüger"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract In many economically highly-developed countries, a relevant proportion of the population migrates across national boundaries every year. For these individuals, migrating abroad not only comes with advantages (e.g. monetary returns) but also with potential pitfalls, because migration is accompanied by profound changes in everyday life. However, only few and mainly cross-sectional studies about individuals’ migration expierences exist, analysing the effects of migration on their quality of life. This study addresses these lacunae and investigates shifts in subjective well-being (SWB) of internationally mobile German citizens. We apply fixed effects (FE) panel regression models to data of the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS). To observe SWB in the course of migration, we draw on a sample of repeat migrants—Germans who returned to Germany shortly before the panel and migrated again across international borders during the panel. As counterfactuals, we focus on Germans who returned to Germany shortly before the panel but stayed there. Overall life satisfaction is used as an SWB-indicator, which corresponds to a global assessment of one’s life situation. In sum, our analyses reveal a happiness dip before migration as well as an increased and relatively stable SWB at the pre-migration baseline level in the first two years after migration.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"ca3a534a3749c6f55ff21304e80847ea","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/mig-and-swb/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current-work/mig-and-swb/","section":"current-work","summary":"International migration and its consequences for subjective well-being","tags":["International migration","Well-being","GERPS"],"title":"International migration and subjective well-being","type":"current-work"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research and regular monitors about the integration of immigrants has typically looked at “objective” indicators of integration such as education, stable employment, language skills or income. In the past years, however, increasingly more attention has been given to the “inner life” of immigrants, referring to more “subjective” indicators of integration such as their emotional attachment to the new home, their feelings of belongingness to its society or their perceptions of discrimination.\nWith the continued publication of empirical studies on immigrants’ subjective integration, an integration paradox has been revealed: Many of those immigrants who seem integrated in terms of their education or occupational status do not feel that they are.\nSuch a misalignment can be problematic because it may increase the likelihood of frustration, mental health issues, and emigration. But the seemingly better integrated are particularly valuable for receiving societies because they can play an important role in helping new arrivals to participate and incorporate into the institutions of the mainstream society. Furthermore, they are more efficiently deployable in the local labour market and less at risk from unemployment. These issues are particularly pressing in times when many developed countries face labour shortages and compete for talents globally.\nThis project bundles personal work on the integration paradox. It looks at different factors and mechanisms that contribute to this paradox, and tries to better understand the potential issues and consequences related to it.\nRelated work 2022 | Status and Ethnic Identity.

This so-called integration paradox is probably caused by higher educated migrants perceiving more discrimination in ambiguous or unfavourable situations. Here we examine unmet expectations migrants have about their life abroad, experience of discrimination, and how these account for educational differences in destination attachment. We use cross-sectional and panel data of recent migrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey, capturing unmet expectations with a question on dissatisfaction with the migration decision. In line with the integration paradox, we observe lower destination attachment among higher educated migrants with unmet expectations. Although they more often report discrimination, this does not explain their lower destination attachment within this group. Instead of discrimination, adaptation problems matter. Higher educated migrants with unmet expectations do not outperform their lower-educated counterparts on other integration dimensions, particularly in social terms. These results indicate that migrants do not necessarily link unmet expectations to discrimination. Migrants may be optimistic and particularly vulnerable to disappointment but they can also mitigate more detrimental consequences, because they are prepared for moving into an unfamiliar environment despite lacking locally important resources.\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"bb8c7d25a26a2ab9712aa8c5f2a70fda","permalink":"https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/expectations-and-attachment/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/current-work/expectations-and-attachment/","section":"current-work","summary":"Unmet migration expectations and disappointment","tags":["Expectations","Discrimination","Belonging","Integration Paradox","MMS"],"title":"Unmet migration expectations and their consequences for the lives of immigrants","type":"current-work"},{"authors":["Andreas Genoni"],"categories":null,"content":" Suggested Citation: Genoni, A.
