      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next year&amp;rsquo;s IMISCOE conference takes place in sunny Lisbon from July 2 to 5. Together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ru.nl/en/people/geurts-p&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nella Geurts&lt;/a&gt; (Radboud University), I&amp;rsquo;m submitting a panel with contributions that aim to unravel the Integration Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you conduct research in this field and have something to contribute? We kindly invite you to submit your &lt;strong&gt;250 words abstract until September 25&lt;/strong&gt; to andreas.genoni(at)bib.bund.de. If you have any questions regarding the panel, please reach out to Nella (nella.geurts(at)ru.nl) as I&amp;rsquo;ll be on vacation until the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;panel-description&#34;&gt;Panel description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many immigration societies, researchers and policymakers still often evaluate the integration status of migrants in terms of more objective indicators such as residence duration, birth place, or education. Thus, when thinking of less and more successful integration, we tend to have specific groups of migrants in mind. However, a considerable number of studies has illustrated that exclusively focusing on more objective indicators of integration is problematic as they do not necessarily match with how migrants perceive their own integration. Opposing classic assimilation theories, various studies have found support for this so-called Integration Paradox where migrants, typically with a higher socio-economic position, feel more socially excluded and less belonging to the residence country. The panel aims to dive into this counterintuitive finding in various ways, for example by examining specific sub-groups, disentangling underlying mechanisms, and exploring new outcomes of interest. We aim to better understand the reasons for why seemingly integrated migrants do not feel like they are, and engage in discussions about individual and societal consequences that arise from this paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth biannual conference of the Academy of Sociology took place at the University of Bern. I presented ongoing collaborative work about &lt;strong&gt;unmet migration expectations and why they are more consequential for higher than for lower educated immigrants&lt;/strong&gt;. Have a look at the presentation slides for first insights into the project. It&amp;rsquo;s an updated version of my talk in Lausanne earlier this year. Email me if you&amp;rsquo;d like to know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is collaborative work with my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://druedin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Didier Ruedin&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Neuchâtel. We thank all participants for their constructive feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High hopes, high disappointment?</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2023-06-15-shp-conference/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-happens-when-expectations-of-immigrants-about-live-abroad-do-not-meet-with-their-experiences&#34;&gt;What happens when expectations of immigrants about live abroad do not meet with their experiences?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk about how unmet migration expectations influence the lives of immigrants. I started this work together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://druedin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Didier Ruedin&lt;/a&gt; (University of Neuchâtel) last winter during my research stay at the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) on Migration and Mobility Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using panel data of the Migration-Mobility Survey (MMS), we observed that unmet migration expectations hit harder on immigrants with tertiary education than immigrants with non-tertiary education. We found robust evidence for comparably stronger perceptions of discrimination (picture) and increased emotional disengagement with Switzerland. Stay tuned for the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Individual consequences of international migration</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/project/consequences-of-international-migration/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://a-genoni.github.io/project/consequences-of-international-migration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A question that I am particularly interested in is how international migration impacts the lives of immigrants. This question is a tough one, because it is one of cause and effect and requires unique data to address it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it is not sufficient to compare individuals after their move abroad with non-migrated individuals in their home country, because differences between these groups may be the result of specific characteristics of the individuals within the two groups. If we imagine that migration can be a stressful life event, individuals who move abroad might be healthier and more resilient than individuals who stay put, because migration would otherwise not be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if researchers would find physical and mental health advantages among migrants, it would be unclear whether they made this discovery because migrants are genuinely healthier and happier, or because migration itself may have contributed to their increased health and happiness. By the way, the thought of migration as a potentially positive life event is not far-fetched at all, because migration may not only be stressful but also open up individual opportunities to develop and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, addressing the question of cause and effect of migration places an extremely high demand on data. They have to be longitudinal and must include actual migration events. This enables researchers to observe individuals before, during and after their move abroad, and to compare these different stages with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can researchers find and survey individuals who &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; move abroad during the time of a planned panel survey? Unless researchers are blessed with foresight, they have to come up with a promising strategy. Luckily, my colleagues at the BiB did so. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gerps-project.de/gerps/EN/Project/Project.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS)&lt;/a&gt; meets these high data demands. Following Germans who shortly moved abroad or returned to Germany before the survey started, we collected data of a internationally highly mobile population with a high probability of being internationally mobile again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work listed below is based on these unique data. It aims to tighten the boundaries of causal inference by shedding light on the actual consequences of international migration for immigrants&amp;rsquo; lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unmet migration expectations and their consequences for the lives of immigrants</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/expectations-and-attachment/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration research suggests that higher educated migrants report weaker
attachment to their destination country than their lower-educated counterparts.
This so-called integration paradox is probably caused by higher educated migrants
perceiving more discrimination in ambiguous or unfavourable situations. Here we
examine unmet expectations migrants have about their life abroad, experience of
discrimination, and how these account for educational differences in destination
attachment. We use cross-sectional and panel data of recent migrants to Switzerland
from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey, capturing unmet expectations with a
question on dissatisfaction with the migration decision. In line with the integration
paradox, we observe lower destination attachment among higher educated migrants
with unmet expectations. Although they more often report discrimination, this
does not explain their lower destination attachment within this group. Instead
of discrimination, adaptation problems matter. Higher educated migrants with unmet
expectations do not outperform their lower-educated counterparts on other integration
dimensions, particularly in social terms. These results indicate that migrants
do not necessarily link unmet expectations to discrimination. Migrants may be
optimistic and particularly vulnerable to disappointment but they can also mitigate
more detrimental consequences, because they are prepared for moving into an unfamiliar
environment despite lacking locally important resources.&lt;/p&gt;
