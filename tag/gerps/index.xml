      <description>&lt;p&gt;I gave a lightning talk at the BiB&amp;rsquo;s Turning Gold conference about &lt;strong&gt;shifts in subjective well-being in the course of international migration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;a study with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bib.bund.de/EN/Institute/Staff/Stawarz/Stawarz.html;jsessionid=CA1C73D7435F153D69470FF104799585.intranet662&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nico Stawarz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Institut/Mitarbeiter/Ette/Ette.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Andreas Ette&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Institut/Mitarbeiter/Rueger/Rueger.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Heiko Rüger&lt;/a&gt; (all BiB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using unique longitudinal data that includes actual migration events (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gerps-project.de/gerps/EN/Home.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GERPS&lt;/a&gt;), we find robust evidence that the subjective well-being of internationally mobile individuals increases notably with their move abroad (picture).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural distance and immigrant adjustment</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/cd-and-adjustment/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultural distance (CD) between the country of origin and destination
country of migrants has long been considered important for adjustment in
international migration. Past research has mainly followed a cost perspective,
pointing to rising costs in adjustment with increasing CD, postulating a negative
linear relationship. Following this logic, previous studies overlooked potential
benefits of CD for adjustment. We address this gap by taking a more differentiated
perspective on CD and adjustment. Using unique probability-based survey data on
German migrants in 38 destination countries with a maximum length of
stay of 36 months, we examined different CD-levels and their consequences for
adjustment. We ran multilevel regressions for sociocultural and psychological
adjustment. Importantly, our findings indicate that the CD effect on adjustment
is not linear but clearly resembles an inverted-U shape for both adjustment
dimensions. This result challenges the cost perspective and suggests an “optimal”
range of intermediate CD as most beneficial for recent migrants’ adjustment. We
conclude that the prevailing view on the consequences of CD for migrant adjustment
holds true for very large CDs, but it underestimates the challenges for culturally
close migrants and overlooks that a certain level of cultural dissimilarity can
facilitate migrants’ adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>International migration and subjective well-being</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/mig-and-swb/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many economically highly-developed countries, a relevant proportion
of the population migrates across national boundaries every year. For these
individuals, migrating abroad not only comes with advantages (e.g. monetary
returns) but also with potential pitfalls, because migration is accompanied by
profound changes in everyday life. However, only few and mainly cross-sectional
studies about individuals’ migration expierences exist, analysing the effects
of migration on their quality of life. This study addresses these lacunae and
investigates shifts in subjective well-being (SWB) of internationally mobile
German citizens. We apply fixed effects (FE) panel regression models to data of
the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS). To observe SWB in
the course of migration, we draw on a sample of repeat migrants—Germans who
returned to Germany shortly before the panel and migrated again across international
borders during the panel. As counterfactuals, we focus on Germans who returned
to Germany shortly before the panel but stayed there. Overall life satisfaction
is used as an SWB-indicator, which corresponds to a global assessment of one’s
life situation. In sum, our analyses reveal a happiness dip before migration as
well as an increased and relatively stable SWB at the pre-migration baseline
level in the first two years after migration.&lt;/p&gt;
