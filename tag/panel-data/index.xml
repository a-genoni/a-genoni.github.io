      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;do-you-study-the-integration-paradox-ip&#34;&gt;Do you study the integration paradox (IP)?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, I kindly invite you to apply to participate in an international research workshop on the topic, which I co-organise in June &amp;lsquo;25 with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ru.nl/en/people/geurts-p&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nella Geurts&lt;/a&gt; (Radboud University) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uu.nl/staff/CLavest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chloé Lavest&lt;/a&gt; (Utrecht University).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration paradox describes the phenomenon that seemingly well-integrated immigrants and their descendants often experience more discrimination and weaker belongingness to their new place of residence than their not-so-well-integrated counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IP literature has expanded significantly in recent years, but it still falls short on longitudinal perspectives and empirical evidence on the underlying mechanisms and scope of countries and migrant groups studied. We thus call for papers to further advance IP research and connect with other colleagues in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop will take place &lt;strong&gt;at Utrecht University on June 18, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, just before the Migration and Societal Change conference. We plan to produce a Special Issue based on the contributions presented during the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://a-genoni.github.io/uploads/CfP-workshop.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;span &gt;this information sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-deadline-for-applications-is-february-1-2025&#34;&gt;The deadline for applications is February 1, 2025.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to receiving your submissions!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The conference summer goes on</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2024-09-22-sgs-and-ecsr/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2024-09-22-sgs-and-ecsr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, almost everybody in the office had his/her conference trip this year. Thus, it was about time to head out myself to meet new people, chat with dear colleagues, and talk about ongoing projects to get some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ssa-an-early-integration-paradox&#34;&gt;SSA: An early integration paradox?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first stop was Muttenz, a place close to Basel, where this years congress of the Swiss Sociological Association (SSA) took place. I had the opportunity to present an ongoing research project of &lt;a href=&#34;https://druedin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Didier Ruedin&lt;/a&gt; (Université de Neuchâtel) and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project uses longitudinal data of immigrants who recently arrived in Switzerland to explore the possibility of an &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; integration paradox as we refer to it. Scholars typically argue that the integration paradox, the phenomenon that seemingly integrated immigrants do not perceive themselves as integrated, actually reflects progress in integration. The reasoning behind this argument is that if immigrants and locals become more similar, the smaller differences become more salient and potentially problematic&amp;ndash;particularly for immigrants with visually distinct phenotypical markers or clothing. Clearly, this argument neglects the situation of recent immigrants who are at the beginning of their integration process. In our study, we investigate whether immigrants in this early stage might experience an integration paradox as well, and discuss why visually distinct immigrants of all people might be less affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ecsr-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-out-migration-of-recent-immigrants-to-switzerland&#34;&gt;ECSR: Should I stay or should I go? Out-migration of recent immigrants to Switzerland&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stop was Barcelona, the capitol of Catalonia. The European Consortium for Sociological Research (ECSR) held its annual conference at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Besides getting inspired by great people and their projects, I had the honour to present a project of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/ideso/membres/wanner/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Philippe Wanner&lt;/a&gt; (Université de Genève), &lt;a href=&#34;https://druedin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Didier Ruedin&lt;/a&gt; (Université de Neuchâtel) and myself, in which we investigate whether unmet migration expectations increase the chance that immigrants leave the country to which they have just immigrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created an original panel data set by linking Swiss survey data with Swiss admin data. This way, we connected individual-level information of immigrants with registry information on their whereabouts after they have dropped out of the survey. This project takes a behavioural perspective on the integration paradox and investigates whether disappointment about life abroad not only weaken immigrants&amp;rsquo; emotional bonds to their destination country but also actually make them leave. Your hunch? Have a look at the findings &lt;a href=&#34;https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/outmigration/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New research at the 16th ESA conference</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2024-08-27-esa-conference/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2024-08-27-esa-conference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I took advantage of everyone being OUT of office to be productive IN the office, my dear colleagues Lenore and Nico presented ongoing mutual work in sunny Porto at the 16th ESA conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-integration-paradox-among-the-most-religious-migrants&#34;&gt;An integration paradox among the most religious migrants?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint study with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Institut/Mitarbeiter/Sauer/Sauer.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lenore Sauer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Institut/Mitarbeiter/Milewski/Milewski.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nadja Milewski&lt;/a&gt; investigates the relationship between migrants&amp;rsquo; level of education, degree of religiosity, and feelings of belongingness. We use data from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bib.bund.de/P/Transfar/EN/About/Transfar.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TransFAR project&lt;/a&gt;, a BiB survey about Eritrean and Syrian recent refugees in Germany. In essence, our study examines whether the degree of religiosity is an explaining factor for the so-called integration paradox, the phenomenon that highly educated migrants do not really feel as integrated as one would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;return-of-the-failed-the-subjective-well-being-of-german-returnees&#34;&gt;Return of the failed? The subjective well-being of German returnees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Institut/Mitarbeiter/Stawarz/Stawarz.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nico Stawarz&lt;/a&gt; presented the second study, in which we investigate shifts in the subjective well-being of German migrants in the course of their return to Germany. By looking at well-being trajectories of Germans with different return motives, we put contradicting theories about reasons for return migration to the test. Are returnees really those who lost the game of migration and travel back defeated, or could they be those who have successfully completed their stay abroad? This is collaborative work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.martijnhendriks.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Martijn Hendriks&lt;/a&gt; (Erasmus University Rotterdam).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New publication about the well-being of international migrants</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2024-03-20-publication-swb/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2024-03-20-publication-swb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moving abroad can both be a challenging but also rewarding event in people&amp;rsquo;s lives. Internationally mobile people often leave relevant others and material belongings behind and often find themselves in an unfamiliar environment, within which they sometimes even face reservations from the local population. As if all of this is not enough, moving abroad needs careful planning ahead, ensuring that crossing national borders and changing one&amp;rsquo;s place of residence is in accordance with all involved countries&amp;rsquo; laws. Sounds quite stressful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so much stuff going on in the process of emigration, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep track of how well international migrants are doing overall. Clearly, just looking at how their income changes with the move doesn&amp;rsquo;t do justice to everything that is going on. We thus took a different approach an looked at shifts in the subjective well-being of individuals that are in the process of leaving their country to life somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is unique as it is one of the first that is following people throughout their whole emigration process. This is made possible with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gerps-project.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS)&lt;/a&gt;, a longitudinal study that is representative of the internationally mobile German population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-results-in-a-nutshell&#34;&gt;The results in a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are able to show a general increase in people&amp;rsquo;s well-being during their emigration. Importantly, this increase is not short-term as well-being remains elevated in the first years after migration. The extent of the change in well-being thereby systematically depends on negotiation processes related to the migration decision: accompanying individuals (so-called trailing partners) experience the smallest gains in well-being compared to those who made the migration decision jointly with their partner or those who were the driving force behind the migration (so-called leading partners). Being unconstrained by a partner, singles even showed more pronounced increases in their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-we-learn-from-the-study&#34;&gt;What can we learn from the study?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that, despite its associated challenges, international migration is generally positive for people from affluent societies. The increasing internationalization of education and careers, along with subsequent high return rates, supports policies that promote international mobility as recurring events in people&amp;rsquo;s lives. However, the findings also highlight potential social inequalities between those who migrate internationally and those who don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting and enriching things in my profession is the chance to get to know great and like-minded people from all around the world, exchange ideas with them, learn from them, laugh with them and collaborate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, my dear colleague and friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ru.nl/en/people/geurts-p&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nella Geurts&lt;/a&gt; (Radboud University, NL) visited me at the BiB in Wiesbaden to work on a mutual project based on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gerps-project.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GERPS data&lt;/a&gt;. We had the chance to present our work in process in front of my BiB fellows and to get valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wonder what the project is about? Well, we do not want to already spoil too much at this point but you can already find an abstract &lt;a href=&#34;https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/reactive-cosmopolitanism/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should I stay or should I go? Unmet migration expectations and out-migration of highly educated recent immigrants</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/outmigration/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many knowledge-based economies are facing growing needs for skilled labour due to ageing populations, unsustainable fertility rates, and the ongoing green and digital transitions. Governments therefore increasingly depend on highly skilled immigrants in particular to respond to these challenges. However, highly skilled immigrants are probably more at risk of leaving their current country of residence compared to their lower-skilled counterparts. Empirical evidence suggests that highly skilled immigrants react comparably stronger to unmet migration expectations as their expectations to do well, fare well and be treated equally are particularly high, thus being more prone to be disappointed. Being highly qualified and more likely to cope with monetary and psychological consequences of migration decisions, such disappointment might lead them to pursue alternative career perspectives elsewhere in the global labour market, eventually making them leave the country. Here we analyse how unmet migration expectations of immigrants affect the probability of leaving their current destination country, and whether there are educational differences. We use panel data of recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility (MMS) Survey and link them with administrative data to obtain information on immigrants’ whereabouts after being surveyed. Overall, we find that disappointed migration expectations increase the probability of immigrants to leave the country after the survey. Highly skilled immigrants are generally more likely to leave Switzerland than lower skilled immigrants. Importantly, however, we find that the stronger the migration disappointment, the greater is the likelihood of out-migration for highly skilled immigrants, making them particularly likely to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
