      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does getting the first child affect immigrants&amp;rsquo; socio-emotional life and emotional connection to their country of residence? This question lies at the heart of an ongoing project on which I am working together with my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://demography.cass.anu.edu.au/people/associate-professor-natalie-nitsche&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Natalie Nitsche&lt;/a&gt; (Australian National University). Specifically, we are looking at the intersection of gender and education, and discuss the challenges of every group we study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited ANU in May this year to kick off this project with Natalie and had the opportunity to present preliminary findings at this year&amp;rsquo;s ECSR in Cologne, and on a workshop at the University of Neuchâtel from the &amp;ldquo;Migration and Minorities&amp;rdquo; (Mig-Min) Research Network from the Swiss Sociological Association. We received great constructive feedback. Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract if you are curious about the project. Stay tuned for more in due time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intersectionality in the impact of parenthood among immigrants in a high-income country: Unmet migration expectations among highly educated women and less-educated men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, most highly educated immigrants to Europe are women, many of whom have children after arrival. Unlike their male partners, they often struggle to align professional aspirations with traditional parental role expectations in the destination country. Little is known about how this misalignment affects these women. This study addresses that gap by investigating how gender and education intersect in shaping socio-emotional outcomes upon entering parenthood after immigration. We use panel data from immigrants in Switzerland, a high-income country where traditional family roles and labour market penalties for mothers persist. Using fixed-effects regression, we analyse changes in satisfaction with the migration decision, emotional attachment to Switzerland, and general life satisfaction following first-time parenthood. Results show that highly educated immigrant women experience a decline in migration satisfaction, while emotional attachment and life satisfaction remain stable. In contrast, highly educated immigrant men report increased attachment. Less-educated immigrant men show declines across all three indicators, likely due to the pressures of the male breadwinner role under financial strain. Less-educated immigrant women show patterns similar to their male counterparts. Our findings underscore the importance of intersectional approaches to the migration-family formation nexus and suggest further research on emigration behaviour of immigrant families.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Call for abstracts: Workshop on the integration paradox</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2024-11-20-cfp-ip-workshop/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;do-you-study-the-integration-paradox-ip&#34;&gt;Do you study the integration paradox (IP)?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, I kindly invite you to apply to participate in an international research workshop on the topic, which I co-organise in June &amp;lsquo;25 with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ru.nl/en/people/geurts-p&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nella Geurts&lt;/a&gt; (Radboud University) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uu.nl/staff/CLavest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chloé Lavest&lt;/a&gt; (Utrecht University).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration paradox describes the phenomenon that seemingly well-integrated immigrants and their descendants often experience more discrimination and weaker belongingness to their new place of residence than their not-so-well-integrated counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IP literature has expanded significantly in recent years, but it still falls short on longitudinal perspectives and empirical evidence on the underlying mechanisms and scope of countries and migrant groups studied. We thus call for papers to further advance IP research and connect with other colleagues in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop will take place &lt;strong&gt;at Utrecht University on June 18, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, just before the Migration and Societal Change conference. We plan to produce a Special Issue based on the contributions presented during the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://a-genoni.github.io/uploads/CfP-workshop.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;span &gt;this information sheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-deadline-for-applications-is-february-1-2025&#34;&gt;The deadline for applications is February 1, 2025.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to receiving your submissions!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New blog post: Unmet expectations of immigrants and their consequences</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2023-11-04-nccr-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Highly qualified immigrants often tend to be under the radar of integration monitors. Due to their  qualifications and integration into local labour markets, we typically tend to assume they are fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we find that some of them are not. Highly qualified immigrants often have high expectations about life abroad. This makes them particularly vulnerable to disappointment, giving them a hard time to feel welcome, accepted, and to form emotional bonds to their new home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://druedin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Didier Ruedin&lt;/a&gt; (University of Neuchâtel) and I wrote a short blog post about it, and the potential consequences for both immigrants and host societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the blog post online &lt;a href=&#34;https://nccr-onthemove.ch/blog/departure-for-the-promised-land-unmet-expectations-of-immigrants-and-their-consequences/?lang=de&amp;amp;utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp;utm_source=socialnetwork&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or directly download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://a-genoni.github.io/uploads/10_Genoni%20&amp;%20Ruedin.%202023.%20Departure%20for%20the%20Promised%20Land.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;span &gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The paradox of integration</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/project/paradox-of-integration/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://a-genoni.github.io/project/paradox-of-integration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research and regular monitors about the integration of immigrants has typically looked at &amp;ldquo;objective&amp;rdquo; indicators of integration such as education, stable employment, language skills or income. In the past years, however, increasingly more attention has been given to the &amp;ldquo;inner life&amp;rdquo; of immigrants, referring to more &amp;ldquo;subjective&amp;rdquo; indicators of integration such as their emotional attachment to the new home, their feelings of belongingness to its society or their perceptions of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the continued publication of empirical studies on immigrants&amp;rsquo; subjective integration, an integration paradox has been revealed: Many of those immigrants who seem integrated in terms of their education or occupational status do not feel that they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a misalignment can be problematic because it may increase the likelihood of frustration, mental health issues, and emigration. But the seemingly better integrated are particularly valuable for receiving societies because they can play an important role in helping new arrivals to participate and incorporate into the institutions of the mainstream society. Furthermore, they are more efficiently deployable in the local labour market and less at risk from unemployment. These issues are particularly pressing in times when many developed countries face labour shortages and compete for talents globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project bundles personal work on the integration paradox. It looks at different factors and mechanisms that contribute to this paradox, and tries to better understand the potential issues and consequences related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
