      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does getting the first child affect immigrants&amp;rsquo; socio-emotional life and emotional connection to their country of residence? This question lies at the heart of an ongoing project on which I am working together with my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://demography.cass.anu.edu.au/people/associate-professor-natalie-nitsche&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Natalie Nitsche&lt;/a&gt; (Australian National University). Specifically, we are looking at the intersection of gender and education, and discuss the challenges of every group we study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited ANU in May this year to kick off this project with Natalie and had the opportunity to present preliminary findings at this year&amp;rsquo;s ECSR in Cologne, and on a workshop at the University of Neuchâtel from the &amp;ldquo;Migration and Minorities&amp;rdquo; (Mig-Min) Research Network from the Swiss Sociological Association. We received great constructive feedback. Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract if you are curious about the project. Stay tuned for more in due time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intersectionality in the impact of parenthood among immigrants in a high-income country: Unmet migration expectations among highly educated women and less-educated men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, most highly educated immigrants to Europe are women, many of whom have children after arrival. Unlike their male partners, they often struggle to align professional aspirations with traditional parental role expectations in the destination country. Little is known about how this misalignment affects these women. This study addresses that gap by investigating how gender and education intersect in shaping socio-emotional outcomes upon entering parenthood after immigration. We use panel data from immigrants in Switzerland, a high-income country where traditional family roles and labour market penalties for mothers persist. Using fixed-effects regression, we analyse changes in satisfaction with the migration decision, emotional attachment to Switzerland, and general life satisfaction following first-time parenthood. Results show that highly educated immigrant women experience a decline in migration satisfaction, while emotional attachment and life satisfaction remain stable. In contrast, highly educated immigrant men report increased attachment. Less-educated immigrant men show declines across all three indicators, likely due to the pressures of the male breadwinner role under financial strain. Less-educated immigrant women show patterns similar to their male counterparts. Our findings underscore the importance of intersectional approaches to the migration-family formation nexus and suggest further research on emigration behaviour of immigrant families.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Research workshop on unraveling the Integration Paradox</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/post/2025-06-23-workshop-uu/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the privileges in our profession is certainly the opportunity to combine work with travel. This time, I went to Utrecht, a lovely city in the Netherlands, where I co-hosted a research workshop on the Integration Paradox together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uu.nl/staff/CLavest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chloé Lavest&lt;/a&gt; (Utrecht University) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ru.nl/en/people/geurts-p&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nella Geurts &lt;/a&gt; (Radboud University). The workshop took place at Utrecht University, right before the second Migration and Societal Change (MSC) Conference. This was no coincidence of course. The idea was to join forces and attract as many great people to Utrecht as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshop summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were really unlucky. First, the employees of the dutch railroad company NS went on strike on the day of arrival. While one person from Germany couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the workshop because of that, the other international participants struggled quite a bit to get to Utrecht. Then, at the workshop day itself, we realised that protesters have occupied the building in which our workshop should have taken place. Thanks to Chloé, a last-minute room change was possible. Now, we only had to direct everyone to the new place shortly before the event kicked-off, re-order catering and set up the IT at the new venue. Sounds stressful? Well, at least I can say that we were no longer stressed about conducting the workshop itself&amp;ndash;which was a huge success against all odds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the pleasure to listen to nine interesting presentations that dived into the mechanisms underlying the Integration Paradox. Among others, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soziologie.uni-konstanz.de/diehl/team/prof-dr-claudia-diehl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Claudia Diehl&lt;/a&gt; (University of Konstanz) talked about perceived wage unfairness, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/people/sanne-van-oosten&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sanne van Oosten&lt;/a&gt; (Oxford University) about reasons for heightened discrimination awareness among highly educated immigrants, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wodc.nl/over-het-wodc/organisatie/medewerkers/ben-van-enk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ben van Enk&lt;/a&gt; (WODC &amp;amp; Rotterdam University) about the Integration Paradox from a country-level perspective, focusing on EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented ongoing work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://druedin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Didier Ruedin&lt;/a&gt; (University of Neuchâtel), in which we show that the Integration Paradox isn’t just about highly educated immigrants. Less-educated immigrants also play a role. And depending on how recognisable someone is as an immigrant, the paradox tends to emerge at different stages of their stay in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the MSC Conference, we arranged for &lt;a href=&#34;https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/merlin-schaeffer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Merlin Schaeffer&lt;/a&gt; to be first keynote speaker who opened the event, and organised a roundtable on the Integration Paradox to communicate our insights from the workshop to a wider audience, discuss the current state of research and future avenues within our field. Nella, Chloé, Claudia and I were interested to engage with the audience to hear their opinion on the status quo and promising further research. We were pleasantly surprised how many people attended our roundtable and actively participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the bottom line? The unraveling of the Integration Paradox is ongoing! As a consequence, the field is united by this one term, which at the same time is becoming increasingly obsolete due to the progress in research. Who knows, maybe we need to find a new title for a potential next workshop&amp;hellip; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laudatio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big shout out to everyone who participated in the workshop and the roundtable! Without you, these events wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made much sense. Special thanks go to Chloé and Nella. We were a great team and happy to provide this platform for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
