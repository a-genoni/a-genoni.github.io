      <title>Reactive cosmopolitanism? Migrants&#39; attachment to the EU as a response to social exclusion</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empirical research has established an integration paradox (IP), describing that higher educated immigrants often feel more socially excluded and thus less attached to their destination country than their lower-educated counterparts. However, previous literature illustrates that conceptions of belonging can be derived from various levels, including supranational or more cosmopolitan ones such as Europe or the world as a whole. Combining these insights with studies on reactive ethnicity, we investigate to what extent identifying as cosmopolitan may be a reaction to stronger perceptions of social exclusion, and whether this differs for higher and lower educated immigrants. Our contribution to the IP literature is threefold: First, we explore how the integration paradox applies to supranational belonging by investigating belonging to Europe. Second, we use recent probability-based panel data by studying German migrants in over 130 countries worldwide. Third, by measuring feelings of being left out, we measure perceived social exclusion more broadly than by discrimination alone, arguing that also more implicit and indirect forms of exclusion affect immigrants’ feelings of belonging. Preliminary fixed effects analyses show that intensified feelings of being left out increase European attachment among immigrants in non-European countries, which is solely driven by higher educated immigrants, as lower educated immigrants show no such reactive behaviour. Overall, the study offers a new perspective on the drivers of cosmopolitanism by integrating insights from studies on the IP and reactive ethnicity, thereby also raising questions about the importance of national group membership for so-called world citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The return of the failed? A panel study on the subjective well-being of privileged return migrants</title>
      <link>https://a-genoni.github.io/current-work/return-migration/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant share of international migrants eventually return to their home countries. From a neoclassical economic (NE) perspective, returnees are conceived as ‘failed emigrants’ who return due to unmet emigration expectations. In contrast, the new economics of labor migration (NELM) views returnees as successful migrants who return after achieving their goals abroad. Within this theoretical framework, return migration is often examined in relation to economic outcomes. However, little is known about the impact of return migration on subjective well-being (SWB) as a more global measure of individuals’ life situations. We address this research gap by examining changes in SWB among privileged migrants, focusing on internationally mobile German citizens be-fore and after their return to Germany. Using fixed effects (FE) panel regression models and impact functions, we analyze probability-based data of the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS), which is representative of the target population. Our findings reveal that returnees’ SWB decreases slightly abroad, while remaining stable upon return. We also find that SWB trajecto-ries around return migration are conditional on return motives. In particular, those unhappy about life abroad experience a SWB gain upon return.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is it all about the costs? Cultural distance and adjustment of recent migrants</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultural distance (CD) between the origin and destination country of migrants has long been considered important for individual adjustment. Past research predominantly followed a cost perspective, emphasising rising adjustment costs with increasing CD and postulating a negative linear relationship. Previous studies therefore overlooked potential benefits of CD for adjustment. We address this gap by taking a more differentiated perspective on CD and adjustment. Using probability-based survey data on recent German migrants , we examined migrant adjustment at different CD-levels. Employing multilevel regressions for sociocultural and psychological adjustment, the findings reveal an inverted-U shaped relationship between CD and both adjustment dimensions. This challenges the cost perspective, indicating an “optimal” range of intermediate CD as most beneficial for adjustment. Thus, the prevailing view on negative consequences of CD for adjustment may underestimate the challenges for culturally close migrants, and overlook that certain levels of cultural dissimilarity can facilitate migrants’ adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
